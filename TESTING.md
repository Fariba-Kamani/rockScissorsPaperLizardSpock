Testing was ongoing throughout the entire project development. Chrome DevTools was used while building to find and resolve any issues that arose and to ensure that everything was working correctly as expected. The same tools were also employed to verify that the project is responsive, visually appealing, and functions as intended on all standard screen sizes. 
The website has been tested on the following browsers: Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Safari. Additionally, I tested the project on a VivoBook Asus laptop, iPhone 13, iPhone 14, and Samsung Galaxy A14. Furthermore, a few friends conducted additional testing on both Android and iOS mobile devices. 

### Automated testing

#### W3C Validator

  - HTML: No errors were returned for index.html, find-match.html, gallery.html, and submit.html when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/).

  - CSS: No errors were found for style.css when passing through the official [Jigsaw validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).

#### Lighthouse

I used Lighthouse within Chrome DevTools to test the performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO of the website. I have included the test results below.
